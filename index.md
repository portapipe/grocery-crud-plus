## This is Grocery CRUD PLUS

Based on [Grocery CRUD](https://www.grocerycrud.com) (from now on GC and GC+) by scoumbourdis, this project will aim to create an always work-in-progress addon to the main library.

Every module will be available freely on the github project page, plus the versioning will help you to find any old module you need.

### Why I should use it

First of all you don't have to, but if you'll use it you'll have more from GC, and this is a community project, so you can ask or pull your own module based on what you really need.

### Installation

There are a model and a module's folder that has to be placed on the application/model folder.


### How to use it

```markdown
$this->load->library("grocery_CRUD_Plus");

```

For more details see [the official Wiki](https://github.com/portapipe/grocery-crud-plus/wiki).

### What's next?

I want to be clear: this is an open project and I expect not only me but anyone that want something to help increase the modules, so the functionality, of GC.
Anyone using GC knows that scoumbourdis want it the more stable as it could be and this is one of the main reason GC is so popular, but the more you use, the deep you go, the more stuff you need. That's why we've created GC+ (portapipe with scoumbourdis, but ask portapipe for anything!).
